        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 bottle lager beer</li>
            <li>1 tbsp brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 tsp dry mustard powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp onion powder</li>
            <li>1/8 tsp ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1/8 tsp dry dill weed</li>
            <li>1 lb fresh bratwurst sausages</li>
            <li>1 lb sauerkraut, drained</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix beer, brown sugar, dry mustard, onion powder, pepper, and dill together in a bowl until brown sugar is dissolved.</li>
            <li>Place brats into a large nonstick skillet over medium heat.
                Pour beer mixture over top and bring to a boil.
                Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Uncover and increase the heat to medium.
                Boil the sauce until it reduces to a thick, syrupy liquid, about 20 minutes.
                Tilt the skillet to roll brats in the sticky sauce until thoroughly coated.
                Transfer brats to a plate and cover to keep warm.</li>
            <li>Add sauerkraut to the skillet and stir to combine with any leftover sauce;
                cook for 5 to 8 minutes.
                Transfer sauerkraut to a serving platter and top with warm brats.</li>
        </ol>
